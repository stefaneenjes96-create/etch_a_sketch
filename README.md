This will be a project from The Odin Project.
The goal is to make a etch a sketch webapp.

I will be implementing the following feutures:

- a default 16x16 square grid template.
- when you click on a square it will change it's color.
- when you hold your mouse button and move over the squares they will change their color.
- a option to change the color being used.
- a option to change color to rainbow (random colors).
- a option to change to apply a darkening effect.
- a option to change the amount of squares. limit is 100.
